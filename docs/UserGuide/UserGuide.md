# ClinVar Search - User Guide

## Overview

ClinVar Search is a graphical application that allows users to extract, filter, and search variants from VCF (Variant Call Format) files, and to retrieve clinically relevant variant information from ClinVar. Users can view variants by patient and by HGNC gene name, and access ClinVar annotations through a simple graphical interface, without the need for programming or command-line tools.

This guide explains how to use the app entirely through the graphical user interface (GUI).
